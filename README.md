# FYP: Transfer Learning with SNNs for Handwritten Analysis
This repository presents a cutting-edge approach to handwritten analysis leveraging the unique capabilities of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Using the <a href="https://github.com/genn-team/pynn_genn">PyGeNN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/genn-team/ml_genn">mlGeNN</a> frameworks, we implement a transfer learning model tailored for the intricate task of recognizing and interpreting handwritten characters from diverse scripts provided by the <a href="https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot">Omniglot</a> dataset.

**Key Features:**

- **PyGeNN and mlGeNN** Integration: Utilises the powerful and flexible PyGeNN and mlGeNN libraries for constructing and training SNNs, providing a seamless experience in handling spiking neural network architectures.

- **Omniglot Dataset:** Employs the Omniglot dataset, known for its extensive collection of handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, making it an ideal choice for testing the efficacy of SNNs in handwritten analysis.

- **Transfer Learning Approach:** Incorporates transfer learning techniques to adapt pre-trained networks to new tasks, significantly reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources while improving model performance.
  
- **SNN Advantages:** Harnesses the energy efficiency and temporal data processing capabilities of SNNs, making the model particularly suited for real-time applications and devices with limited power capacities.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Includes detailed documentation covering setup instructions, usage guidelines, and explanations of the underlying principles of SNNs and transfer learning.

- **Sample Scripts and Notebooks:** Provides ready-to-use scripts and Jupyter notebooks for quick start and demonstration of the modelâ€™s capabilities.

- **Community and Contributions:** Encourages contributions and feedback from the community, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement of the project.
